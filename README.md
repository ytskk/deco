Hello, my name is Andrey, Iâ€™m practicing Flutter developer. For a while I have been working on the useful project, in my opinion, and thrilled to share with you. 

### Motivation 
I began to think what more complicated I can do. I got to know the Dev community a while ago and found it very interesting and promising. What a surprise it was that it didn't have a mobile app, not even a community app. Somehow that's how I came up with the idea of creating an open source Dev app. I'm looking forward to any suggestions, whether it's development help, design, or new features.

### Quick overview 
Let's talk about the features you can see in the app for now. In the process of development there were a lot of ideas that I really hope to implement. Some, of course, are limited by the capabilities of the API.  I'll make a roadmap a bit later.

#### Select preferred tags
By default you can read popular articles and the newest ones at once (the output may be a little weird, you may give out articles in different order, not update articles for a long time, but that's all because of the API's peculiarities). Right on the home page you can add the tags you are interested in and read the current articles.

#### Theming
App lives in light mode and dark mode, of course. Just one of the future features is the ability not only to change the accent color, but also to completely change the appearance of the application, adjusting to a comfortable and favorite format for you.
